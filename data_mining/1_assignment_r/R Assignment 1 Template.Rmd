First, you will need to install the **readr** and **mosaic** packages. Go to (above menu) Tools -> Install Packages and type each package one (readr) by one (mosaic) and install them. Be sure you have the newest R and Rstudio installed on your computer. After installing them, you can load the packages here.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(mosaic)
```

Import the **treadmill** data file into a data frame (table) and label it yournameData (FrankData). Keep in mind that The R language is case sensitive. What is put inside the " " will depend on the location and name of your saved .csv file.

```{r}
FrankData <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSU-Robinson/Data/main/treadmill.csv")

```

Complete the rest of the notebook tasks by inserting a chunk and type the code.
